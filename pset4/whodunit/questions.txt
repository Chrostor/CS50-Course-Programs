1) What's stdint.h?
It's a header file that gives some typedefs (classes) that specify exact width integer types with max and min values per type.

2) What's the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
Unsigned integers can't be negative values, and each of the unsigned int types from stdint.h allows you to use only the space you need.

3) How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG and a WORD, respectively?
BYTE = 1 Byte, DWORD = 4 Bytes, LONG = 4 Bytes, WORD = 2 Bytes.

4) What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be?  Leading bytes used to identify file
formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers".
Hex = 0x42 0x4D, Dec = 66 77, ASCII = BM

5) What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
bfSize is the size in bytes of the bitmap file, biSize is the number of bytes required by the structure (what structure?)

6) What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
negative indicates top down DIB with origin in the upper-left corner, biCompression must be either BI_RGB or BI_BITFIELDS, and cannot
be compressed.

7) What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
The biBitCount

8) Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
If fopen returns NULL, then the file doesn't exist

9) Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
Because we only want to read the elements once?  Not sure on this one.

10) What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
3, apparently, but I don't know why.

11) What does fseek do?
Allows you to change the offset of the file pointer

12) What is SEEK_CUR?
a constant value that changes the location of the pointer in the fseek function
